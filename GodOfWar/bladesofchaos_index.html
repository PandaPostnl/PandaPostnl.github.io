            <h1>Blades of Chaos:</h1>
            <a><img src="images\using blade chaos.jpg"></a>
            <p>“As for Kratos, no mere sword and shield would befit the newest servant of the God of War. The Blades of Chaos, forged in the foulest depths of Hades. Once attached the blades remained so, chained and seared to the flesh, a part of the bearer's body. A permanent reminder of Kratos' pledge…”</p>
            <p>The Blades of Chaos are introduced in God of War as Kratos’ signature weapons throughout the Greek Era. Forged in the depths of the Underworld and personally offered to Kratos by Ares himself, the Blades became a symbol of the Spartan’s servitude to the Olympians, emphasized by the chains bound to the very flesh of his arms. Widely feared throughout Greece, the Blades of Chaos personified what Kratos had become during the darkest period of his life: a monster who killed his own family out of bloodlust, turning him into the infamous Ghost of Sparta.</p>
            <p>The Blades of Chaos were forged in the darkest depths of the Underworld by Ares himself. They were imbued with primordial fire, which allowed them to ignite with every attack that the user performed. The Blades' chains would stretch out for a set distance with each attack, allowing for fluid movement no matter who wielded them. The chains of the blades were permanently seared onto the forearms of the wielder, which served as a reminder of their oath to the God of War, and could only be removed either by the God of War himself or when the wielder's time of servitude ended. However, when their creator is dead with the servant still owning them, they can be removed or equipped, whenever needed.</p>
            <a><img src="images\kratos badass.jpg"></a>
            <p>After Kratos pledged his life to the God of War, Ares had his Harpies fetch the Blades of Chaos and bestowed them on the Spartan, claiming they were weapons truly worthy of a God's Champion. After Ares decimated the Barbarian forces, Kratos used his new weapons to slay the Barbarian King, Alrik, in single combat. Kratos continued to utilize the Blades during his time of servitude to Ares and the Gods - even against his own wife, Lysandra, and daughter Calliope, whom he unknowingly killed while he was in a god-driven rage that was set by Ares.</p>
            <p>The old Blades later return during the Norse Era in God of War (2018) as Kratos’ secondary weapons. Symbols of a shameful and particularly painful past, Kratos indeed swore to bury them forever, never to be used again. Although these cursed weapons have been replaced by the Leviathan Axe, the Spartan reluctantly carried them once more out of his love for his son, eventually saving the latter's life.</p>
